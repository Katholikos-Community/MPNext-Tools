 * These live here rather than in `src/proxy.ts` for one reason: the proxy's
 * matcher deliberately skips `_next/static`, `_next/image`, `favicon.ico` and
 * `assets/`, and these headers should still reach those responses (and `/api`).
 * The Content-Security-Policy is the exception and lives in the proxy, because
 * its nonce must be regenerated per request — see `src/lib/security-headers.ts`.
 *
 * Anti-framing is expressed TWICE on purpose: `X-Frame-Options` here covers the
 * routes the proxy skips, and `frame-ancestors` in the CSP covers the rest.
 * They are not both CSP headers — two `Content-Security-Policy` headers on one
 * response are enforced as an INTERSECTION, which is miserable to debug.
